# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
We were asked by our client at Pewlett-Hackard to hel them prepare for their upcoming "silver tsunami," which is what they've dubbed the massive amount of employees who will likely be retiring in the next few years. We were given two objectives: 
  * To provide the number of retiring employees based on title the currently hold, and 
  * To identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program that Pewlett-Hackard is going to pilot, where near-retirees will be able to move into part-time positions and help train employees for their roles after they retire.

## Analysis
Utilizing data they had already provided, and queries we'd already created, we created:

* A "Retirement Titles" table that holds all the current titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Then, we counted how many were near retirement by title.
* An "Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program" that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. 

## Results

## Summary
<Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami.">
  * How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  * Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
